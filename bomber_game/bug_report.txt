Bug 1: The plane can't drop any more bombs after the previous bomb missed a building.#solved
	
-	The game runs well in the beginning but once the plane has missed a target, no more bombs can be dropped and so it leads to game over.

-    Instead, after missing, there should be more bombs to be dropped in order for the game to work well and so that the user can progress through the game.

-	To reproduce it, the building widths can be reduced so that it is easier for the bombs to miss the them.
	
-	The bug is caused by the bomb_falling boolean variable not resorting to false once the bomb misses the buildings. So tecnically, the bomb is still falling when it
	doesn't hit anything and keeps falling even after exiting the canvas.

 

Bug 2: Before game over, the 'r' key press exits the game like the 'q' key.#solved

-	If the game is still running before game over and the player restarts the game, the game closes completely.

-	Instead, it should reload the game with a new set of random building heights.

-	Run the game and press the 'r' key immediately.

-	The game exits because the program encounters an error while it is running, the canvas.delete() function uses the argument msg_text which is not previously defined
	in the program.



Bug 3: The bomber is never able to hit the right-most building and if the player tries to target it, the bombs don't drop anymore.#solved

-	As the game starts, the plane starts from a point right above that building and immediately starts moving to the left, this makes bombing that building almost
	impossible.

-	The plane should ideally be in a position to easily bomb that building everytime it starts from the right.

-	To reproduce it, start the game and immediately drop the bomb or drop it in the beginning of the next cycle.

-	One reason this might be the case is the fact that building widths are initially very small and there are too many buildings to start with.



Bug 4: The player can't progress to the next level.#solved

-	When the player has leveled the buildings, the plane doesn't land and the prompt to go the next level is not shown

-	Instead, once the plane reaches the ground, a pop-up should prompt to progress to the next level and stop the game for that time.

-	Just level the buildings and wait for the plane to reach the ground.

-	This happens since the y-coordinate of the plane initially has to be less than the canvas height to win the game, which doesn't make sense and therefore,
	doesn't lead to progress.



Bug 5: The bomb falls from the nose of the plane.#solved

-	When the space bar is pressed, the bomb falls from the nose of the plane to the buildings.

-	It should fall from the center of the plane if the game wants to simulate reality.

-	Just press the space bar and look where the bomb falls from.

-	This is caused by the x and y coordinates of the bomb being exactly same as that of the plane, and since that starts of the top left of the plane,
	this is the result that is produced.
